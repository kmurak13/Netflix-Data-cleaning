# Netflix-Data-cleaning
Using Datasets on Kaggle, I've used this project as an opportunity to practise data cleaning.
The sql file contains the Queries used to achieve the final result set.
The excel files named netflix_titles and netflix1 are the raw data sets used in this project.
We have used the netflix_titles table as the primary table of focus for data cleaning.
The second table netflix1 was only used as secondary table to treat Nulls in the primary netflix_titles table.
Both files were classified as Tables in two diferent databases or Schemas.
The Databases for netflix_titles and netflix 1 were netflix and netflix_data respectively.
